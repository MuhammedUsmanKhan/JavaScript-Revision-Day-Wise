// Interview Question:
// Why we need functions ?
//                        We need functions because we can define function once and then we can reuse it many times after calling our function (with same or different arguments)
// Function Expression is a terminology means we are assigning our function calling to a variable

// Function Anonymous is a terminology which means that we are assigning the complete function into a variable at the time of defining a function

// For Example:

// var sum_Function = function (x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// };

// sum = sum_Function(5, 7);

// console.log("The sum of two numbers is : " + sum);
